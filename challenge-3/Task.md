# Route Performance Analysis

## Overview

In this stage, the objective is to evaluate the efficiency of flight routes by analyzing key performance metrics such as average flight duration, total passengers served, and income generated per route. This analysis will provide valuable insights into route profitability and passenger demand, which can aid in optimizing airline operations and resource allocation.

## Objectives

### 1. Identify Unique Routes
- Create unique route identifiers by concatenating the `town_from` and `town_to` from the **Trip** table. Name this concatenated value as `route`.

### 2. Calculate Average Flight Duration
- Compute the **average flight duration** (`avg_flight_duration`) in minutes for each route. Since there may be multiple flights for the same route with varying durations, calculate the average flight time for each unique route.

### 3. Count Total Passengers
- Count the total number of passengers who have flown on each route, and name this value as `total_passengers`.

### 4. Calculate Total Income
- Calculate the total income generated by each route, considering that each second of flight generates **one cent**. Convert the final total into **dollars**, and name this value as `total_income`.

### 5. SQL Functions and Joins
- Use the `JOIN` function to accurately combine data from the **Trip**, **Passenger**, and **Pass_in_trip** tables to gather the necessary information for flight durations, passenger counts, and income calculations.

### 6. Sort by Income
- **Order** the final results by `total_income` in **descending order** to highlight the most profitable routes.

### 7. Column Order and Output
- The final output should include the following columns:
  1. `route` (Concatenated Departure and Arrival Cities)
  2. `avg_flight_duration` (Average Flight Duration in Minutes)
  3. `total_passengers` (Total Number of Passengers)
  4. `total_income` (Total Income in Dollars)

- Ensure that the **column order** is correct in the final output.

## Conclusion

By completing this analysis, you will be able to identify the most efficient and profitable routes, providing valuable insights into how airline resources can be better allocated to maximize both passenger satisfaction and revenue.
